This is being created so that we can move faster while using the [cloudflare-rs](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-rs) repo.
There are quire a few gaps on the upstream repo, so this is one way that we can do the necessary changes for us for now. Hopefully we can remove this and fully use the official repo in the future.
