description: How to configure services to work with Linkup
---

In order to grasp how linkup works, it's important to understand three core concepts in linkup:

1. Linkup manages "sessions" which are unique views of connected services
2. Linkup can route individual requests to very specific components
3. Linkup can run components that enable requests to be routed by linkup

## Linkup Sessions and Subdomains

Whenever you create a new linkup session, either for a local environment or for a preview environment, you will receive a unique linkup session name, which is a subdomain of your linkup domain.

For example, `linkup start` might give you a `slim-gecko.example.com` (local environment) subdomain. Or `linkup preview` might give you `xyz123.example.com` (preview environment) subdomain.

This linkup session name will be used to identify all of the requests that belong to that session.

## Identifying and Routing Requests to Sessions

All requests that reach linkup go through an identification process to determine which session they belong to. Requests that can't be identified are rejected as a precaution.

Request to session identification uses two methods:

- Common browser headers, primarily `Referer`.
- Opentelemetry tracing headers `traceparent` and `tracestate`.

For all requests you make within a linkup session, they will either come straight from the browser (identified by your linkup subdomain `slim-ant.domain.com`), or they will come from an underlying service.

Linkup will add opentelemetry tracing headers to all requests it receives, but you will likely need to _propogate_ these headers through your services. Please refer to the [OpenTelemetry documentation on how to do this for your specific language and framework](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/).


### Routing Requests Example

Letâ€™s study this example linkup session state:

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "frontend",
      "location": "https://my-pr-frontend-123.preview.com",
    },
    {
      "name": "api",
      "location": "https://latest-api-main.shared-infra.com",
    },
    {
      "name": "auth",
      "location": "https://latest-auth-main.shared-infra.com",
    }
  ],
  "domains": [
    {
      "domain": "example.com",
      "default_service": "frontend",
      "routes": [
	      {
		      "path": "/auth.*",
		      "service": "auth"
	      }
      ]
    },
    {
      "domain": "api.example.com",
      "default_service": "api",
      "routes": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Let's work through a few example requests to this environment. Given that your session name is `smart-snake`, what do you think will happen for the following requests:

<details>
  <summary><code>curl -I https://smart-snake.example.com</code></summary>
  <p>HTTP <code>200</code>, routed to <code>frontend</code> service</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><code>curl -I https://smart-snake.example.com/auth/login</code></summary>
  <p>HTTP <code>200</code>, routed to <code>auth</code> service</p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary><code>curl -I https://api.example.com/</code></summary>
  <p>HTTP <code>422</code>, no way to identify session</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><code>curl -I https://api.example.com/ -H "Referer: https://smart-snake.example.com"</code></summary>
  <p>HTTP <code>200</code>, routed to <code>api</code> service</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><code>curl -I https://api.example.com/ -H "tracestate: linkup-session=smart-snake"</code></summary>
  <p>HTTP <code>200</code>, routed to <code>api</code> service</p>
</details>

Generally then, the best way to think about the question "will linkup be able to identify this request?" is to think about whether you can answer yes to either of the following questions:

- Does the request come straight from the browser? Then it will have a `Referer` header that includes the linkup session name.
- Have I instrumented the underlying service to propogate the opentelemetry tracing headers? If so, `tracestate` will include the linkup session name.

## Linkup Components

In order to be in a position where LinkUp can actually route these requests based on the identifying information, Linkup needs to run a few components in different places.

### Linkup Cloudflare Worker

The Linkup Cloudflare worker is configured to intercept all requests that reach your Cloudflare zone. A Cloudflare zone is approximately equivalent to a domain, so if you have the domain example.com, it will intercept all requests that are made to *.example.com. This means is that linkup can function as a man-in-the-middle proxy between all requests that your application makes, and can reroute requests to the correct service based on its headers.

### Cloudflare Tunnel & The Local Server

In order to be able to direct traffic to servers that might be running on `localhost` on your machine, the linkup CLI can run a Cloudflare tunnel paired with a local proxying server in order to receive requests that were made from a remote component and deliver them to a server that is running on your local machine.

### Local DNS

In its default mode, Linkup has a fairly strong dependency on the network. For frontend engineers who are running development servers, they may have pages that require 50-100 mb of JavaScript to load.

In order to speed up cases where the network might be a bottleneck, Linkup provides a local DNS mode that is optionally installable on developers' machines. Local DNS will resolve your application's domains directly to servers running on your local machine. This means that all requests that could have been handled directly by your local machine will not go over the public internet. Linkup also has the ability to manage certificates associated with these local domains to make the experience as seamless as possible.

Currently, linkup local DNS uses [dnsmasq](https://www.dnsmasq.org/) to provide local DNS resolution. And [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) to provide tls certificates.
